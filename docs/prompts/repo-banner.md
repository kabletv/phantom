## Prompt

Design a GitHub repository banner image for "Phantom" — an AI-powered development workspace built with Tauri, React, and Rust.

**Composition:**

- Wide cinematic aspect ratio (2:1), landscape orientation.
- The word "Phantom" rendered in a clean, geometric sans-serif typeface — placed left-of-center or centered. The typography should feel architectural: generous letter-spacing, medium weight, all lowercase or small caps. Think Inter, Geist, or Untitled Sans at their most composed.
- Below or beside the wordmark, a single line of secondary text in a lighter weight: "ai-powered development workspace" — understated, almost disappearing into the background.
- The right side (or background) should carry a subtle, abstract visual element — not a screenshot, not a diagram, but an atmospheric texture that suggests depth, structure, and intelligence.

**Visual direction for the background:**

- A field of very faint, barely-visible grid lines or node-and-edge structures — like an architecture diagram seen through frosted glass, or a circuit board dissolving into fog. The lines should be thin (#1a1a1f to #222228 range), with occasional nodes that glow faintly with the accent purple.
- Alternatively: a dark atmospheric gradient with subtle volumetric light — imagine looking down a long corridor of terminals, each one a faint rectangle of light in the darkness, converging to a vanishing point. Not literal — abstract and felt rather than depicted.
- A single, gentle light source from the upper left casting a soft gradient across the scene. The light should feel like dawn through a window, not a spotlight.

**Color:**

- Background: #09090b (near-black) with subtle gradient toward #111113 or #1a1a1f.
- Text: #ececf0 (off-white) for the wordmark, #8b8b96 (muted gray) for the subtitle.
- Accent: #7c6aef (muted purple) used only for one or two glowing elements in the background — a node, a cursor, a faint line. Not on the text.
- No other colors. Strictly monochrome + single accent.

**Style constraints:**

- This should look like the hero section of a well-designed developer tool's landing page — Vercel, Linear, Warp, Raycast tier.
- No screenshots, no UI mockups, no code snippets in the banner.
- No stock photography, no 3D renders of floating objects, no abstract blobs.
- No AI-slop aesthetics: no iridescent gradients, no "holographic" effects, no geometric patterns that look procedurally generated without intention.
- Clean negative space. Let the composition breathe. Less is more.
- The banner should work both on light GitHub pages (it will have its own dark background) and in dark mode.

**Mood references:**

- The opening frame of a film before the title card — dark, atmospheric, expectant
- An empty IDE at night with just a cursor blinking
- The way a well-designed CLI tool prints its version number — clean, quiet, confident
- Deep space with a single distant nebula

**What to avoid:**

- Busy layouts with multiple visual elements competing for attention
- Bright colors or high-saturation gradients
- Terminal emoji, code brackets, or literal developer iconography
- Anything that looks like a Canva template
- Drop shadows on text, text outlines, or other effects that reduce legibility

**Output:** 2560x1280 PNG (will display at 1280x640 on GitHub). Ensure text is crisp at both sizes.
